Resonate Technical Test

Please attempt as many questions as is possible.


Level 100:
Write methods for below, you can choose any language or use pseudocode to represent your answer. Please stick to one technology for answering all the questions that require you to write code.
1.	Remove duplicates from an unsorted list (12,11,12,21,41,43,21)
2.	Accept two strings and return true if one string is a permutation of the other


Level 200:
Our national retail client has a 200-store branch network, they want to do a big promotion give-away. To participate, customers must enter their email address with a unique code (which is printed on their dockets) into OUR website. No store has more than 10,000 customers/day.
The code must be no more than 9 characters long, and we have to be able to get the following information out:
-	Which store does the code belong to?
-	Which date was the code issued?
-	Which customer (transaction) did the docket belong to (a number starting again at 1 every day)
Consider how easy it is for the end users to read/copy the code into the website and how we can prevent cheaters.
Write the code for this algorithm (in any language of your choosing).



Real world problem:
